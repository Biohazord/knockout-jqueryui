<h2>
    What makes it different</h2>
<p>
    There are several knockout bindings for jQuery UI widgets, madcapnmckay's <a href="https://github.com/madcapnmckay/Knockout-UI">
        Knockout-UI</a>, thelinuxlich's <a href="https://github.com/thelinuxlich/knockout_bindings">
            knockout_bindings</a> and medmunds' <a href="https://gist.github.com/889400">knockout-jquery-ui-widget.js</a>
    to name a few. Below are some features which differentiates knockout-jqueryui from
    them.
</p>
<h3>
    Binding factory</h3>
<p>
    Each binding is generated by the same binding factory, similarly to rniemeyer's
    <a href="https://github.com/rniemeyer/knockout-kendo">knockout-kendo</a>. This ensures
    that the size of the library remains small and makes it a lot easier to maintain/extend
    at the same time. The binding factory also provides extension points to which the
    bindings can hook their own functions to execute widget-specific initialization
    logic.
</p>
<h3>
    Isolated binding parameters</h3>
<p>
    Normally each binding on the same DOM element <a href="http://www.knockmeout.net/2012/06/knockoutjs-performance-gotcha-3-all-bindings.html">
        fire together</a>. Knockout-jqueryui's bindings isolate their parameters from
    the parameters of the other bindings. This makes them faster, and arguably
    more natural to use.
</p>
<h3>
    Proper disposal</h3>
<p>
    When an element is removed from the DOM (typically by an ancestor template binding)
    onto which a knockout-jquery binding is applied, then the binding destroys the widget.</p>
<p>
    As a workaround for IE7's z-index bug, the dialog widget's constructor
    moves its element from its original position to the end of the DOM tree. Knockout-jqueryui's
    dialog binding will properly dispose the widget when some of its original ancestor
    node is removed (typically by an if/with/foreach binding).</p>
<h3>
    Synchronous operation</h3>
<p>
    A common design pattern for container-like bindings is to execute their initialization-
    and update logic asynchronously. This ensures that their descendant elements' bindings
    are applied prior to their own initialization/update. Unfortunately this makes following
    the execution path harder while debugging.</p>
<p>
    Knockout-jqueryui takes a different route, its bindings explicitly invoke ko.applyBindingsToDescendants()
    before creating their widget.</p>
